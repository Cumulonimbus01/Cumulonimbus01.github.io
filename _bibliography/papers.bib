  abstract={The joint Taiwan-Area Heavy Rain Observation and Prediction Experiment (TAHOPE)/Prediction of Rainfall Extremes Campaign In the Pacific (PRECIP) field campaign between Taiwan and the United States took place from late May to mid-August in 2022. The field campaign aimed to understand the dynamics, thermodynamics, and predictability of heavy rainfall events in the Taiwan area. This study investigated the mechanisms of a heavy rainfall event that occurred on 6–7 June during the intensive observation period-3 (IOP3) of the field campaign. Heavy rainfall occurs on Taiwan’s western coast when a Meiyu front hovers in northern Taiwan. A multiscale radar ensemble data assimilation system based on the successive covariance localization (SCL) method is used to derive a high-resolution analysis for forecasts. Two numerical experiments are conducted with the use of convective-scale (RDA) or multiscale (MRDA) corrections in the assimilation of the radial velocity from operational radars at Chigu and Wufen, and the additional S-Pol radar deployed at Hsinchu during the field campaign. Compared with RDA, MRDA results in large-area wind corrections, which help reshape and relocate a low-level mesoscale vortex, a key element of this heavy rainfall event, offshore of western central Taiwan and enhances the front intensity offshore of northwestern Taiwan. Consequently, MRDA improves the 6-h heavy rainfall prediction over the coast of western Taiwan and better represents the elongated rainband in northern Taiwan during the 3- to 6-h forecast. Sensitivity experiments demonstrate the importance of assimilating winds from Chigu and S-Pol radar in establishing low-level mesoscale vortex and convergence zones.},
