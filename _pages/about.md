How does the cloud form? How does the precipitation system grow extremely strong, leading to devastating weather condition? When and How the weather system propagate in the future?
This is what I am currently doing. **Understanding the weather system and Improving its predictability**, especially in **mesoscale phenomenon**.

I'm interested in **cross scale interaction in the mesoscale precipitation systems** within the **multi-scale ensemble data assimilation system (WRF+LETKF)**. My research is mainly focused on how the **environmental dynamic adjustment can affect the validity of the precipitation system predictions**. In strong synoptic forcing condition, the adjustment in scale of 100-km is significant to improve the prediction availibility.

The research is still in progress, including several adjustment of the system. **1. What is the optimal setting in localization length and the density of the datasets in this multiscale framework? 2. How can we add information in smaller scale (Scale-Dependent Inflation) 3. How to explain the major setback of not scale-awared background error covariance (BEC) structure?**
Also, I am still wondering the **better explainable framework** in explaining the corss-scale interactions. KE spectrum seems a good choice, but I am not 100% sure. FSS only provides precipitation with respect of scale.
